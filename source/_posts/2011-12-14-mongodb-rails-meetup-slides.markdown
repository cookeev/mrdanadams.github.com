I had a great time at the [Rails meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Rails-Boston) hosted by [Cantina](http://cantina.co/2011/11/30/come-to-the-meetup-boston-ruby-on-rails-meetup-group-lightning-round/) last week. People were gracious enough to sit through my talk no MongoDB, an overview how to use it, and how to use it with Ruby / Rails. Slides are [posted on Speaker Deck](http://speakerdeck.com/u/danadams/p/mongodb-on-rails) and embedded below. Thanks to those who attended and I'm looking forward to the next one.
