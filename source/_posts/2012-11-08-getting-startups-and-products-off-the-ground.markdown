In the past several months I've been embedded in [Dogpatch Labs](http://dogpatchlabs.com) working with early-stage startups, first [ByteLight](http://www.bytelight.com/) and then [BlockAvenue](http://www.blockavenue.com/), to create their core product and get them to the next level. Each project is different but both faced the challenges of a pre-MVP product and small team. Here's some of what's involved, the challenges faced, and approaches to tackle them.

## What Have We Got Ourselves Into?

When I walk in the door, my first priority is to get my bearings and gain an understanding of the situation. To a frustrating extent, nearly everything that comes out of my mouth at this point will be a question. I want to how things are and how they got that way. This extends far beyond technology.

* Who are the founders? Who are the key influences (founders or not)? What is the dynamic between them and the rest of the team? Who makes the decisions? Who's the leader on paper and who really leads?
* What technology is in place now? Why was it selected? What issues have they had with it so far?
* What are the skills of the current team both technically and non-technically? Do they have good communication skills? Do they understand application architecture? Have they ever scaled anything or worked with large data sets? How do they handle conflict and stress?

Keep asking why until you really understand your context. If needed, take someone out to lunch or ask small questions in the break room to get perspectives you can't get in a group meeting. Paradoxically, humans are what make software difficult and understanding the team is critical.
