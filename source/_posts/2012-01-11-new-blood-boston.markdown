I attended the [New Blood Boston](http://new-blood-boston.eventbrite.com) event, hosted by [Bocoup](http://bocoup.com), which featured and introduced a handful of Boston startups. Awesome food ([grilled cheese](http://www.grilledcheesenation.net/) and [good beer](http://www.prettythingsbeertoday.com)) combined with a crowd of some of the most capable people in the boston tech scene made for a great event.
