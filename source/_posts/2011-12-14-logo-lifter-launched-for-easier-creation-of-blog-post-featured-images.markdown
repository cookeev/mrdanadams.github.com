Introducing [http://logolifter.com](http://logolifter.com/), a free and simple tool for more easily creating images for blog posts and other content. Search for what you want, drag the images onto a canvas, customize, and download. This project came out of wanting good, relevant, unique images for blog posts and avoiding stock photos.

**UPDATE:** The project is [now on github](https://github.com/mrdanadams/logolifter).

While the name suggests it's meant for logos, it could be used for any kind of content pulling in other images. Search for "kitten" and you'll see what I mean.

It allows you to currently do the following:

* Instantly search for images of various sizes (using Google image search)
* Drag multiple search results into a single image
* Arrange the images to your liking including auto-arrangements (horizontal and vertical), resizing all images to the same size, and adding padding to the outside of the image
* Downloading the resulting image


Let me know if you have any feature comments. I'd love to hear feedback from people using it.
