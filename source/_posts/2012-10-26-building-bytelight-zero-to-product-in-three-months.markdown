[ByteLight](http://www.bytelight.com) is a [Dogpatch Labs](http://dogpatchlabs.com) startup providing indoor positioning. ByteLight uses LED lighting based technology leveraging the existing lighting infrastructure and mobile devices to deliver unprecedented indoor location accuracy and responsiveness. [I](http://cantina.co/author/dadams/) and [Dave Fox](http://cantina.co/author/dave/) from [Cantina Consulting](http://cantina.co/) worked with the ByteLight team to build the product platform from the ground up including a Rails-based admin application design for iPad use, REST API, iOS mobile api, real-time location analytics platform, real-time dashboard, and a handful of hybrid HTML5 and native iPhone apps. Beyond development, we also provided strategic consulting around building around the team including establishing a hiring process.

Here's what we built and how we built a customer-ready product platform in 3 months.

The product video should give you a good sense of what the technology does and what we built:

## Some Context

At the time we engaged, ByteLight was an early stage startup with a great start but facing some real challenges. The co-founders, Aaron Ganick and Dan Ryan, had a really strong core technology and had surrounding themselves with a top-notch team including a board of investors who really know their industry.

ByteLight is an unusual startup in that it's not just a website or some new play or mobile or social media; it's really a hardware startup but needs a robust and complex software infrastructure to bring their core technology to customers. Even the most basic level of support, detecting location with a mobile device and ByteLight LED lights, requires space creation and calibration, map images and tiling, content management, customer management, and analytics.

Now put yourself in the shoes of a co-founder facing not only how to perfect your core IP but designing and building a complex software platform spanning big data, web, and mobile; putting together a team of the best people in a shot job market; and getting the right product to the market before any number of US and international competitors in the exploding space of indoor location.

* competing with some big players in their space
* young team of guys who know their space and technology. but risk on the team and software side is huge.

### Analytics

One of the last things we built in this project, the analytics support is one of my favorite pieces of the platform. In a world where we are constantly focused on web, and now mobile, app usage ByteLight opens up the ability, and necessity, of analytics for the physical world. ByteLight customers can see not only where their patrons are in the physical space in real time but the paths they take, how long they stay in a certain spot, which content they are triggering and interacting with, and much more. This analytics data will inevitably be combined with customer-specific data to reveal deep, invaluable insights into customer behavior allowing retailers, among others, to optimize their physical space and even A/B test the physical world down to a micro level.

For instance, in the world of grocery stores where [products fight for inches on the self](http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2002/0415/130.html) and stores often [pull in a 1% margin](http://smallbusiness.chron.com/profit-margin-supermarket-22467.html), retailers could gain new insight at the store level. A small amount of good data goes a long way and ByteLight can now provide retailers with a huge amount of good data where they need it most.
