Hired guns. Code mercenaries. Consultants.

Whether you are early stage or have an established product, bringing a consultant onto your startup can be a dicey prospect. Here are common reasons not to and some things you may not have thought of.

<!-- more -->

While there is truth to all of these, there's more to be considered. Reality is, many startups are getting a huge boost using outside consultancies (although they may not advertise it) in a world where good people are hard to hire, time to market is tight, and product quality is critical. Hiring a consultant is not always the right thing to do but it's also not ... always not (if you'll pardon the double negative).

## Preamble: Consultant != Contractor

I'm making a significant assumption here in the difference between a consultant and a contractor (this is my definition). 

Consultants (disclaimer: like me) are often brought on for their thoughts and experience in addition to getting the work done. Consultants may even challenge their clients with new ideas and approaches.

Contractors are brought on to perform a task, build a feature, do something specific.

## Reason 1: They're Expensive

If you need to hire a design / engineering consultant (in Boston, at least) you are likely looking at $100 - $250 per hour depending on the shop and what you need. That's roughly $4,000 - $10,000 per week per full time person. Assuming you had a fulltime hire that had a total cost of $150k per year (after taxes, benefits, overhead, etc) that's around $72 / hour.

Ouch.

Of course, this assumes we are comparing cost for the same value. Which probably isn't true. Not only might you be getting something better or different than you have internally but you don't have the same costs associated. A consultant pays their own taxes, vacations, benefits, etc.

You usually don't hire a consultant for a whole year. You bring them on for something specialized or because they offer something you don't have in your internal team or can't (or don't need to) hire. They've got experience and skills that can prove to be invaluable:

* _Strategic insight_. A general knowledge of the industry, best practices, and the ability to pinpoint the best technical or product direction.
* _They're battle-tested_. They've been through the full project lifecycle across different team sizes, contexts, and technologies. This adds crucial perspective that only comes by experience especially the knowledge that comes from previous failures.
* _They're good. Maybe really good._ That's why they are "expensive" (usually). They've got the skills you need and can get things done quickly.

Sometimes you bring on a consultant simply to augment your team and add momentum. Add a consultant or two where it makes sense, crank for a while, and then scale down to a slower pace after the push.

Consider the other side:

* 
* 
* 
* Consultants are easier to let go than salary people
* Consultants come with friends.

In a perfect world, when you needed to grow your team you'd be able to hire passionate, invested people with the skills you need when you need them. That's a fantasy. The reality is that hiring (both salary and consultant) is hard; it takes a lot of your time and involves significant risk.


## Reason 2: They Walk Away with Knowledge

History matters in a startup. The reasons why things are what they are (both good and bad) are important. A consultant may come in, do some great work, and then walk out with all the good bits in their head. This is a legitimate risk for anyone hiring a consultant.

It's not, however, a show stopper:

* Integrate them in the team so that there is knowledge sharing during the work. Make sure other people at least know, and ideally have worked on, their stuff. Do code reviews. Just do them.
* Have them put together documentation during the course of the work (not at the last minute) and use it themselves.
* Embed them in team discussions so they know why the team did what they did and vice-versa. The randoms, informal conversations are often the most valuable.

In general, just don't give a consultant the most important piece of your product and then have nobody else know about it. Add some redundency or mimimize risk by putting them on something else.

## Reason 3: They're Not Invested

Your core team is passionate and invested. You hope. (Let's assume they are.) A consultant is usually seen (rightly) as an outsider who comes in, maybe makes a mess, and walks away. The assumption is that they won't deliver the same quality or be as proactive at addressing problems as your core team.

Again, a legitemate concern.

Get a consultant with a good reputation, a good body of work, and seems like someone you can trust. Protect yourself by getting them as closely integrated with you and your team as possible; tight collaboration will quickly shed light on lurking concerns.


## Allow Me to Illustrate

Here are a few examples of scenarios where bringing in a consultancy might make a lot of sense.

### Get Your Product Off the Ground

As a founder in an early stage startup, you face many challenges in [getting your product off the ground](/2012/tips-startups-products-off-ground). Furthermore, many founders have never designed a product, built a software platform from the ground up, hired a creative team, scaled anything, worked with big data, and might be working on still-developing technologies such as mobile.

That's a big, steaming pile of risk. Building the wrong thing, building it poorly, or taking too long to build the right thing can be a killer.

Bring in a (very) small team of experienced consultants who can not only build the technology but help you understand the product, the technical landscape, and build the right product.

Furthermore, while working with the consultant you can be working on hiring that long-term team.

### Add Momentum to an Existing Product

You've got your core team established and product off the ground.


### Bring in Some Expertise

### Build a Silod Feature

## How to Get It Right

* Talk to the people who do the work
* Look at their __recent__ work
* Ask around. Get word of mouth.
* Go local. Get them in-house.
* Have an out. Be protected.

## Disclaimer & Some Background

I'm a consultant. I'd like to think I'm one of the good ones. But I've also played this game from the other side.

I was the Head of Engineering in a product company creating a new product (essentially a startup from the inside). In order to serve both our old client / agency work and our new product development (while having no up-front capital investment) we had to get creative with engineering resources.

We worked with outside firms in Argentina, Conneticut, New York City, India, Vietnam, and elsewhere.

We worked with independent contractors / consultants in just as many places.

Eventually, we even set up an off-shore development team in Omsk, Russia.

In the first two cases (using contractors / consultancies) my success rate was maybe 25%. That's rough. But once we found a person or shop that worked we set up a long-term relationship with them. In fact, the best contractor I ever worked with was just "some dude" out in Ohio with three kids getting his PhD.

These relationships were a valuable asset and complimented our sizable internal team well. It allowed our business to react to resource needs without reducing internal stuff.
