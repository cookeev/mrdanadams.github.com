Many Dropbox users like myself love the service but have multiple accounts: one for work and one for personal. However, the native clients only support one account at a time. Rather than getting a special app (which are available for some platforms) to allow multiple accounts a simple solution is to share with yourself.

This approach is simple, can be easily changed later, keeps your files private, and allows you to sync select folders rather than everything in your account.

The steps are simple:

Log into the account you wish to share **from** and select the sharing options for that folder.

Enter the email address of your other Dropbox account to share with.

{% img /images/enter_email.jpg %}

That's it! You can also opt to rename the folder to something specific when accepting the share (such as 'Personal' if sharing with a work account).
