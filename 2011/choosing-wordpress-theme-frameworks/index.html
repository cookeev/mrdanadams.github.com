<div class="entry-content"><p>In creating this blog I did a lot of research on options for theming in WordPress including the best theme frameworks. Here are those that look the best and why I finally chose to go with <a href="http://themeshaper.com/thematic/">Thematic</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>A brief intro to WordPress theming</h2>

<p>There are a few ways to do a theme for WordPress:</p>

<ol>
<li>Grab a free one from the theme gallery, buy a pre-made theme, or hire someone to make one.</li>
<li>Write one from scratch including all the PHP files and plugin hooks needed or start with one and modify it directly.</li>
<li>Use a theme framework and create a child theme extending only those things to make your theme unique.</li>
</ol>


<p>Child themes allow you to start with a base theme and override / extend it with custom PHP, CSS, JavaScript, etc where needed to customize. The frameworks are typically built with a solid foundation, lots of extension points, and accomodate plugins, SEO, and other concerns. You can make small changes or (as I did) throw out all the existing styles and go from scratch.</p>

<p>Theme frameworks are also attractive over option #2 since they can be upgraded later without changing the child theme (much).</p>

<p>After considering the options, I decided to go with a theme framework. I want integration with existing plugins while still being able to customize. For doing multiple projects having a framework I&#8217;m familiar with means faster work on the next theme and more predictable results.</p>

<h2>Comparing theme frameworks</h2>

<p>When comparing theme frameworks they tend to differ in these ways:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Price:</strong> The theme framework itself, child themes, and support</li>
<li><strong>Modern support:</strong> Does it support the latest techniques and best practices?</li>
<li><strong>Weight/flexibility:</strong> Some tend to be minimal going for clean code while some tend to have bloated markup supporting any kind of design</li>
<li><strong>Admin features:</strong> How much can you change the theme in the admin?</li>
<li><strong>Theme-specific plugins:</strong> Some themes pre-package support for things like related/popular posts and Twitter</li>
<li><strong>Extensibility:</strong> Is the theme modular? Does it have extension points?</li>
<li><strong>Popularity:</strong> Do designers and developers know this framework? Is there a community around it?</li>
<li><strong>Maturity:</strong> Some frameworks are quite recent (which could be a good thing) but some have been battle-tested</li>
<li><strong>Support:</strong> For both free and commercial frameworks, are they updated frequently and maintained / improved actively?</li>
<li><strong>Target user:</strong> Is the framework targeted at individual developers? Large agencies? Non-technical users?</li>
</ul>


<p>Commercial theme frameworks like <a href="http://www.studiopress.com/themes/genesis">Genenis</a> are specifically targeted at agencies, developers, and designs working for clients who need a cheap, reliable way of producing lots of sites predictably. Many nice-looking child themes are provided at a low price as a starting point for custom client themes.</p>

<p>For my purposes I didn&#8217;t need a lot of control in the admin since I preferred to have all design aspects in the code. For those with clients, however, having robust admin control over the UI and design could be very attractive.</p>

<p>What other criteria do you consider when choosing a theme framework?</p>

<h2>WP Theme Framework (paid)</h2>

<p><img src="/images/wtf.jpg"></p>

<p><a href="http://wtf.dev7studios.com/">WP Theme Framework</a> is $6 for a single license and $300 for themes you want to sell. It&#8217;s got admin options, lots of theme-specific plugins for related posts, popular posts, Twitter, and more.</p>

<h2>Buffet (free)</h2>

<p><img src="/images/buffett.jpg"></p>

<p><a href="http://www.zy.sg/the-buffet-framework/">Buffet</a> is a minimal theme framework with support for SEO, microformats, extension points, and bundles CSS frameworks like <a href="http://www.960.gs/">960gs</a> and <a href="http://www.blueprintcss.org/">Blueprint</a>.</p>

<h2>Starkers (free)</h2>

<p><img src="/images/starkers.jpg"></p>

<p><a href="http://starkerstheme.com/">Starkers</a> is a bare-bones, minimal framework to the point of eliminating all css classes that are presentational and not semantic. To quote the framework&#8217;s site:</p>

<blockquote><p>if you want something super-simple to start out with, stripped down to the bare minimum of markup, use <em>Starkers</em>.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Headway (paid)</h2>

<p><img src="/images/headway.jpg"></p>

<p><a href="http://headwaythemes.com/">Headway</a> goes for $164 for the developer license and $87 for personal. It&#8217;s claim-to-fame is a comprehensive <a href="http://headwaythemes.com/features/visual-editor/">visual editor</a>.</p>

<h2>Genesis (paid)</h2>

<p><img src="/images/genesis.jpg"></p>

<p><a href="http://www.studiopress.com/features">Genesis framework</a> is $60 for the framework and about $25 for each child theme (a $300 bundle is available for all current and future themes). There are a number of nice child themes to start with and is used by many prominent bloggers and the popularity means you could find a designer that already knows it.</p>

<h2>Thesis (paid)</h2>

<p><img src="/images/thesis.jpg"></p>

<p><a href="http://diythemes.com/">Thesis framework</a> is $164 for unlimited use and $87 for one-time use, offers lots of design options through the admin, and is very popular.</p>

<h2>Foghorn (free)</h2>

<p><img src="/images/foghorn.jpg"></p>

<p><a href="http://wptheming.com/foghorn/">Foghorn</a> is a fork of the Twenty Eleven theme modified to be responsive.</p>

<h3>Hybrid (free with paid support)</h3>

<p><img src="/images/hybrid.jpg"></p>

<p><a href="http://themehybrid.com">Hybrid</a> is popular, has a number of child themes, good support, and looks promising. Using the framework is free but joining the community and getting any kind of support is $25 / year.</p>

<h2>Roots (free)</h2>

<p><img src="/images/roots.jpg"></p>

<p><a href="http://www.rootstheme.com/">Roots</a> is based on the HTML5 boilerplate, Blueprint CSS, 960gs, and Starkers. It&#8217;s aims to de-wordpress the market and URLs so your site is as close to hand-rolled as possible. Theme options are minimal so this framework is great if you want something that appears pure. Hosted on github and documentation looks pretty good.</p>

<h2>Whiteboard (free)</h2>

<p><img src="/images/whiteboard.jpg"></p>

<p><a href="http://whiteboardframework.com/">Whiteboard</a> is based on the <a href="http://lessframework.com/">Less CSS grid framework</a> and offers easy responsive design from the start. It features clean, flexible markup, and moderate admin features.</p>

<h2>Thematic (free)</h2>

<p><img src="/images/thematic.jpg"></p>

<p><a href="http://themeshaper.com/thematic/">Thematic</a> is a mature, very popular theme framework with great documentation, a sample child theme that could be skinned for a great theme, a number of other child themes, SEO support, and compatible with many plugins.</p>

<h2>Why I chose Thematic</h2>

<p>I chose Thematic for it&#8217;s price, maturity, popularity, and extensibility. I found it to be a very flexible framework with many extension points that could be used to easily create some very different themes. The admin features are pretty minimal / typical so it may not be a fit for an agency or designer with clients they wish to be self-sufficient but it&#8217;s great for the developer.</p>

<h2>Creating child themes for theme frameworks</h2>

<p>Creating a child theme is actually quite simple. Starting with a parent theme, another theme you will be extending, create a style.css file which acts as the manifest providing basic info about the theme and the primary stylesheet.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes">Child Themes guide on the Wordpress Codex</a> is an excellent start. Yoast has a <a href="http://yoast.com/wordpress-theme-anatomy/">visual anatomy of a theme</a> which is excellent as well.</p>

<p>What has your experience been working with theme frameworks? What is your preferred framework?</p>

          <p>Your career is a business and you should manage it like one. There is a lot to being a great software engineer and therein lies the problem: a focus on the technical (which is important, clearly) but a neglect of business, communication, and management skills needed to be your own career advisor. Without these skills many great, passionate engineers find themselves at a disadvantage working for too little pay or enjoyment.</p>
